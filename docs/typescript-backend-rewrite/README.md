# TypeScript Backend Rewrite

Last updated: 2026-06-25

Status: active rewrite planning and implementation track

This folder tracks the deliberate TypeScript backend rewrite path for Campaign Player Wiki. It is separate from incremental Flask refactor work. The goal is a production-capable TypeScript backend that preserves the current product contract, data safety boundaries, local/Fly operations, and rollback path before replacing Flask.

## Source Of Truth

- `charter.md`: scope, freeze rules, cutover gates, rollback requirement, and branch/spec ownership.
- `parity-inventory.md`: current route, API, data, command, and policy inventory that TypeScript must preserve.
- `route-snapshots.md`: source-derived route declarations and fixture-backed missing-resource response shapes.
- `.local/roadmaps/typescript-backend-rewrite-roadmap.md`: local active task queue for the rewrite track.
- `docs/current-state/INDEX.md`: current product contract index. Use it to confirm present behavior before porting any workflow.
- `docs/api-v1.md`: current JSON API contract.

### Stack Evidence

- `stack-spike.md`: architecture decision record for the TypeScript backend stack evaluation and proof checklist.

## Working Rules

- Python/Flask remains the production authority until TypeScript passes parity gates and a cutover rehearsal.
- TypeScript work starts read-only and fixture-backed before any production write path is added.
- Domain, service, persistence, content, auth, Systems, character, session, and combat logic must not live in React route components.
- Experimental spikes stay in `.task-temp` or an isolated approved workspace until a workspace layout decision is recorded.
- Any Python behavior that ships during the rewrite must either be added to the parity inventory or recorded as an explicit deferred exception.

## Initial Phase Order

1. Rewrite charter and tracked spec home.
2. Product contract and parity inventory.
3. Stack and workspace spike with a written decision record.
4. Framework-free domain and policy packages.
5. Compatibility persistence and migration reads.
6. Auth, API contracts, read-only Gen2 slices, then controlled write paths.

Production cutover is not part of the early phases. It requires backup, migration dry-run, browser rehearsal, production smoke checks, and an approved rollback window.
