# Phase Closeout Evidence Anchors

Last reviewed: 2026-07-21

Status: accepted sanitized evidence ledger

This tracked ledger anchors final ignored lifecycle/postmortem records without
tracking private or machine-local evidence. A row proves only the named file's
bytes and accepted Git identity; deployment and live status require their own
evidence.

| Phase | Accepted commit | Accepted tree | Relative lifecycle record | Bytes | SHA-256 | Finalized UTC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Flask rewrite Phase 5 | `8766292816f2f91f10085f09f2e372651545eced` | `292d130a3e76b5208061dd7f58b477305461530b` | `.local/roadmaps/flask-rewrite-phase5-lifecycle-evidence.md` | 141787 | `60BAD34535C3309BB0D4E582F397AB96375F1DAC0CAE7C68F2DFCA9079927E0E` | `2026-07-20T14:27:37.3353132Z` |
| Flask rewrite Phase 6 (final cleanup outcome; 8 physical residual HOLDs) | `2c6774b269995320c149dd81e59d842304e740a8` | `c297efdfaa67e6aa98bef3d52194100fc47948f0` | `.local/roadmaps/flask-rewrite-phase6-lifecycle-evidence.md` | 371652 | `C816031831A065F0B1EE9970EF02A77289D97DC4A01797DF21172E87291CDBEE` | `2026-07-21T20:08:33.9714736Z` |

The Phase 6 row anchors the final cleanup-outcome canonical record. Git cleanup
is main-only, while eight exact unregistered physical residual directories
remain on filesystem-safety `HOLD`. The latest pushed documentation/evidence
identity before this refresh is `510b5a85bbaf33897fa44aade9005344ef16203e`.
This final anchor refresh is documentation/evidence only and was not redeployed.

For each future row, verify the record from the canonical main worktree after
final postmortem replacement. Record only the repository-relative path, exact
byte count, uppercase SHA-256, accepted commit/tree, and finalization time.
Never record secret contents, personal absolute paths, private campaign facts,
or hashes of secret-bearing material.
